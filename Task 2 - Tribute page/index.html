    <h2>üß† Visionary Programmer</h2>
    <p>
      Terry A. Davis was an exceptionally gifted programmer best known for creating <strong>TempleOS</strong>, 
      a lightweight operating system that he built completely on his own. From the kernel to the compiler, 
      everything was written in a custom language called <em>HolyC</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è TempleOS: A Divine Operating System</h2>
    <div class="image-center">
      <img src="porting-third-party-programs-to-templeos.00117.png" alt="TempleOS Command Line">
    </div>
    <p>
      TempleOS was designed to be a modern-day Third Temple ‚Äî a system Davis believed he was divinely instructed to build.
      It runs in 16-color VGA, uses a simple command interface, and serves as both a spiritual and technical statement.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Davis‚Äôs HolyC language was a hybrid of C and scripting, tightly integrated with TempleOS. It allowed users 
      to write and execute code instantly, emphasizing speed and simplicity in a truly unique environment.
    </p>

    <h2>üß© Genius and Struggle</h2>
    <p>
      Terry Davis was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the early 2000s. Despite his mental health challenges, 
      he produced some of the most impressive solo software development work ever seen. His behavior was often erratic, 
      but his brilliance was undeniable.
    </p>

    <h2>üåü A Legacy of Raw Talent</h2>
    <p>
      Davis passed away in 2018, but his story continues to inspire developers around the world. 
      TempleOS is not just an operating system ‚Äî it‚Äôs a symbol of what one person, driven by pure vision and 
      raw talent, can create against all odds.
